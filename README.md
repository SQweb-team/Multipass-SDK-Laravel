**This package allows you to easily integrate SQweb on your Laravel powered website.**

##Requirements

**This SDK has been tested with PHP 5.5 and greater.**

We are unable to provide official support for earlier versions. For more information about end of life PHP branches, [see this page](http://php.net/supported-versions.php).

##Install

**This package is intended for websites powered by Laravel, and advanced integrations.**

If you're using WordPress, we've made it easy for you. Download the SQweb plugin [directly from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqweb/), or check out the source [here](https://github.com/SQweb-team/SQweb-WordPress-Plugin).

###Using Composer

1. In your project root, execute `composer require sqweb/laravel_sdk`;
2. Now, go to config/app.php and add this line to your providers array: `Sqweb\Laravel_sdk\SqwebServiceProvider::class,`.
3. Type `php artisan vendor:publish` at the root of your project to create the configuration file.
4. Sets the `SQWEB_SITE_ID` variable in your .env file to your SQweb website ID.

For additional settings, see "[Options](#options)" below.

##Usage

The SDK is really simple to use. Here's how to:

###1. Tagging your pages

This function outputs the SQweb JavaScript tag. Insert it before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML.

```php
{{ $sqweb->script() }}
```

**If you previously had a SQweb JavaScript tag, make sure to remove it to avoid any conflicts.**

###2. Checking the credits of your subscribers

This function checks if the user has credits, so that you can disable ads and/or unlock premium content.

Use it like this:

```php
@if ($sqweb->checkCredits())
    //CONTENT
@else
    //ADS
@endif
```

###3. Showing the Multipass button

Finally, use this code to get the Multipass button on your pages:

```php
{{ $sqweb->button() }}
```

###4. More functions

1.This function is used to display only a part of your content to non premium users:
```php
function transparent($your_content, $percent) { ... }
```
`$percent` is the percent of your content you want to display to everyone.

Example:
```php
{{ echo transparent('one two three four', 50) }}
```
Will display for free users:
```
one two
```

2.The following function is used to display your content later for non paying users:
```php
function waitToDisplay($your_content, $publication_date, $date_format, $wait) { ... }
```
1. `$publication_date` is the date when your content is published on your website.
2. `$date_format` is the format of your publication date ('Y-m-d' for '2016-12-18').
3. `$wait` is the number of day you want to wait before showing this content to free users.

Example:
```php
{{ echo waitToDisplay('I will appear for everyone in 2 days', '15/09/16', 'd/m/y', 2) }}
```

3.The next function is used to limit the number of articles free users can read a day:
```php
function limitArticle($number_of_articles) { ... }
```
`$number_of_articles` is the number of articles a free user can see.

Example if I want to display only 5 articles to free users:
```php
@if (limitArticle(5) == true)
	echo "This is my article";
@else
	echo "Sorry, you reached the limit of pages you can see today, come back tomorrow or subscribe to Multipass to get unlimited articles !";
@endif
```
