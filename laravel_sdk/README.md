**This package allows you to easily integrate SQweb on your Laravel powered website.**

##Requirements

**This SDK has been tested with PHP 5.5 and greater.**

We are unable to provide official support for earlier versions. For more information about end of life PHP branches, [see this page](http://php.net/supported-versions.php).

##Install

**This package is intended for websites powered by Laravel, and advanced integrations.**

If you're using WordPress, we've made it easy for you. Download the SQweb plugin [directly from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqweb/), or check out the source [here](https://github.com/SQweb-team/SQweb-WordPress-Plugin).

###Using Composer

1. In your project root, execute `composer require sqweb/laravel_sdk`;
2. Now, go to config/app.php and add this line to your providers array : `Sqweb\Laravel_sdk\SqwebServiceProvider::class.
3. Type `php artisan vendor:publish` at the root of your project to create the configuration file.
4. Go to `config/sqweb.php` and set your `ID_SITE`, others options are detail further on this page.

For additional settings, see "[Options](#options)" below.

##Usage

The SDK is really simple to use. Here's how to:

###1. Tagging your pages

This function outputs the SQweb JavaScript tag. Insert it before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML.

```php
{{$sqweb->script();}}
```

**If you previously had a SQweb JavaScript tag, make sure to remove it to avoid any conflicts.**

###2. Checking the credits of your subscribers

This function checks if the user has credits, so that you can disable ads and/or unlock premium content.

Use it like this:

```php
@if ($sqweb->checkCredits())
    //CONTENT
@else
    //ADS
@endif
```

###3. Showing the SQweb button

Finally, use this code to get the SQweb button on your pages:

```php
{{$sqweb->button()}}
```
